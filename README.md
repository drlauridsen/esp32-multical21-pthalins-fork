### Build and Upload Firmware
* Make sure you have a decryption key for your meter (you need to ask your water service provider for it).
* Read the serial number on the meter (typically S/N: XXXXXXXX/A/20, the serial number is the XXXXXXXXX part).
* Rename credentials_template.h to credentials.h and add your details.
* Compile and upload:
  - You need [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [PIO Plugin](https://platformio.org/)
  - Open the project folder with the platformio.ini file (File -> Open Folder...), connect the ESP32 via USB then build and upload with Ctrl+Alt+U.

### Home Assistant

Setup [MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) if you don't already have it.

Add this to configuration.yaml
```
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Water Meter Usage"
      state_topic: "watermeter/0/sensor/mydatajson"
      unit_of_measurement: "m³"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.CurrentValue }}"
      device_class: water
      state_class: total_increasing
      availability:
        - topic: "watermeter/0/online"
          payload_available: "True"
          payload_not_available: "False"
    - name: "Water Meter Month Start Value"
      state_topic: "watermeter/0/sensor/mydatajson"
      unit_of_measurement: "m³"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.MonthStartValue }}"
      device_class: water
      state_class: total_increasing
    - name: "Water Meter Room Temperature"
      state_topic: "watermeter/0/sensor/mydatajson"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.RoomTemp }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    - name: "Water Meter Water Temperature"
      state_topic: "watermeter/0/sensor/mydatajson"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.WaterTemp }}"
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"
```
